      <h1>We are not what you think</h1>
      <h3>We are exactly what you think</h3>
      <p>We here at the Illuminati headquarters, located in an undisclosed location in or around Barstow, CA, know what it's like to be a simple, normal human.
         We have feelings too. It was only several centuries ago that we were the outcasts of society, but after banding together and destroying all our enemies from within, 
        we have realized that happiness does not come from the heart, rather it flows out of the blood of your enemies after you have vanquished them.</p>
      <p>We also know that the world is, to put it mildly, a bit chaotic. Know that, although we are the all powerful Illuminati, we didn't do this. Covid is something 
        something else completely. We have our best secret scientists on the vaccine, but it will still be a little while before it's ready to distribute to our brothers/sisters/others 
        strategically placed around this flat earth (did we mention the earth was flat, yet). So, when you see specific world leaders on stage, campaigning to get reelected, just 
        know that, although we may have a somewhat...different set of values than the population, we are not responsible for this. We just want to distance ourselves from...certain leaders.</p>

      <p>Thank you, and remember,</p>

          <p>It had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them. They went out and happened to things.</p>
