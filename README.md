# Illuminati
This is a project for my CIS3110 course for client-side web development. After entering your name and age, it will run the age against a randomly generated number between 1 - 100.
If your age is over the random number, you are granted access to all the Illuminati secrets.

The purpose was to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make an interactive web page that would take user input and change the page based on the results of the inputs. 

I wanted to make this fun, so I went with Illuminati.
